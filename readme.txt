Project_title - Anti-Phishing Email Analyzer

Overview
The Anti-Phishing Email Analyzer is a Python-based tool that scans email content to detect potential phishing attempts. It works by identifying common phishing keywords and analyzing URLs within the email to determine if they are suspicious. This project is designed for beginners in cybersecurity and can be used to better understand how phishing emails are detected.

Features
Keyword Analysis: The analyzer checks for common phishing keywords in the email content (e.g., "verify your account," "click here," "update your information").
Link Analysis: Extracts and analyzes URLs in the email. Suspicious URLs that donâ€™t match trusted domains (e.g., google.com, amazon.com) are flagged.
Beginners Friendly: Simple and easy-to-understand code for those learning about phishing and cybersecurity.
Requirements
Before running the project, you will need to install the following Python packages:

re (for regular expressions, included by default in Python)
tldextract (for analyzing URLs)
To install tldextract, run:

pip install tldextract

Project Setup
Clone or download the repository.
Navigate to the project directory.
Ensure you have installed the required packages (listed above).
Create or modify the email_content.txt file with email content to be tested.
How to Use
Prepare the Email Content: Create a text file named email_content.txt and paste the email content you want to analyze.
Run the Script: In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory and run:

python anti_phishing_analyzer.py

View Results: The script will analyze the email content and display potential phishing keywords and suspicious URLs (if any).
Example Output
For a phishing email, the output will look something like this:


Potential phishing keywords found: ['verify your account', 'update your information', 'sensitive information']
Suspicious URLs found: ['http://secure-login-fb.com/verify', 'http://amazon-security-check.com/update']
